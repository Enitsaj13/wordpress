A person goes through indoctrination, a series of sessions where the basic teachings and beliefs of the Christian faith are taught. The doctrines are based on the words and examples of the Lord Jesus Christ in the Bible. Once a person accepts the Church\u2019s doctrines, he or she can then be baptized. A Church minister oversees the baptism ceremony.<\/li><li><strong>Can I have indoctrination that is flexible with my time?<\/strong> Yes. You may contact or visit a locale near you to have it set at your preferred time. Also, you may contact us so we can find you the nearest locale and have our brethren get in touch with you the soonest.<\/li><li><strong>Will I become a member when I attend indoctrination?<\/strong> Sadly, no. A person must finish learning the doctrines, accept the teachings, and be baptized before becoming a member. This is to make sure that those who will become members of the Church are aware of what is expected of them (1 Timothy 3:15).Becoming a member of the Church is a personal choice. While we invite all to learn the Lord\u2019s doctrines, no person is forced to believe and accept them. Membership is voluntary and based on one\u2019s free will.<\/li><li><strong>How can I go to an MCGI locale?<\/strong> We can help you locate an MCGI locale near you.
